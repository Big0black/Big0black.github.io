<p class="verse">If I die young, bury me in satin<br>
Lay me down on a bed of roses<br>
Sink me in the river at dawn<br>
Send me away with the words of a love song,<br>
Uh oh, Uh oh</p><p class="verse">Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother<br>
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors<br>
Oh, and, life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no<br>
Ain't even grey, but sheburies her baby</p><p class="verse">The sharp knife of a short life<br>
Oh well, I've had just enough time</p><p class="verse">If I die young, bury me in satin<br>
Lay me down on a bed of roses<br>
Sink me in the river at dawn<br>
Send me away with the words of a love song</p><p class="verse">The sharp knife of a short life<br>
Oh well, I've had just enough time</p><p class="verse">And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom<br>
As green as the ring on my little cold finger<br>
I've never known the loving of a man<br>
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand</p><p class="verse">There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever<br>
Who would have thought forever could be severed by<br>
The sharp knife of a short life<br>
Oh well, I've had just enough time</p><p class="verse">So put on your best, boys and I'll wear my pearls<br>
What I never did is done<br>
A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar<br>
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner<br>
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing<br>
Funny, when you're dead how people start listen'n</p><p class="verse">If I die young, bury me in satin<br>
Lay me down on a bed of roses<br>
Sink me in the river at dawn'<br>
Send me away with the words of a love song</p><p class="verse">The ballad of a dove<br>
Go with peace and love<br>
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket<br>
Save them for a time when you're really gonna need them,<br>
The sharp knife of a short life oh<br>
Well, I've had just enough time<br>
So put on your best boys<br>
And I'll wear my pearls</p><p class="verse">.</p>	</div>
